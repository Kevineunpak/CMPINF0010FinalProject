- Description and links to the datasets used
  - Dataset 1: [Number of speed bumps in Pittsburgh Neighborhoods](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-speed-humps)
    - This data conveys how many speed bumps there are in several Pittsburgh neighborhoods. It is applicable as a metric because we found that more speed bumps lead to a worse experience in street racing. So, we are trying to find the neighborhoods with the least amount of speed bumps.
  - Dataset 2: [Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/d809c36f-28fe-40e6-a33e-796f15c66a69/resource/e554650d-f48f-49b2-88f3-e19878a1c245/download/arrest-data-dictionary.xlsx)
  - Dataset 3: Traffic Count Data
  - Dataset 4: City of Pittsburgh Crosswalk

We concluded that **Highland Park** is the best neighborhood since it has the least amount of traffic and the 4th least amount of speedbumps in Pittsburgh.
