- Description and links to the datasets used
  1. [Number of speed bumps in Pittsburgh Neighborhoods](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-speed-humps)
    - This data conveys how many speed bumps there are in several Pittsburgh neighborhoods. It is applicable as a metric because we found that more speed bumps lead to a worse experience in street racing. So, we are trying to find the neighborhoods with the least amount of speed bumps.
  2. [Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/d809c36f-28fe-40e6-a33e-796f15c66a69/resource/e554650d-f48f-49b2-88f3-e19878a1c245/download/arrest-data-dictionary.xlsx)
  3. Traffic Count Data
  4. City of Pittsburgh Crosswalk
